### Project specification: [link](https://github.com/idankario/BookShoop-Cpp).

### Overview

The purpose of this work is to develop a system for coordinating the sales, orders and stock management of a book editor, while following the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles. As such, a building block can play any of three roles, the service provider, the service registry and the server requester. The customers are capable of doing an order in the store.
